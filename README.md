## Rules

*These rules are provisional, and subject to change.*

In the microbiome game players compete to develop the healthiest microbiome, while attempting to disrupt each others efforts.

### Game preparation

 * Shuffle the deck and give 5 cards and one player sheet to each player
 * Deal 3 cards face up in the center of the table
 * The player who has most recently eaten yogurt goes first

### Turn order

1. **Exchange (Optional)** Discard one card and draw one of the face up cards.  You may only do this once per turn.   Replace the missing card with the top card of the deck.
2. **Main Phase** You can only play one Microbe per turn (either on yourself or another player).  During the main phase you can play any number of non-Microbe cards.  You can never play cards during another players turn.
  * *Playing a Microbe*:  Pathogen Microbes can only be played in the Pathogen Zone.  Beneficial Microbes can only be played in the Beneficial Zone.  Opportunistic Microbes can be played into either zone.  Note that you can play a microbe on yourself, or on an opponent.
3. **Scoring** After your main phase is complete, you score your microbiome.  Microbes in your beneficial zone give points as indicated in the green circles on the card.   Microbes in your pathogen zone subtract points as indicated in the red circles on the card.
4. **Draw back to 5 cards**
5. **Turn ends**

### Card Types

There are four types of cards; Microbes, Events, Plasmids, and Infections.

 * **Microbes (Orange)**:  These represent (so far) bacteria that you are using to either make a healthier microbiome for yourself, or to disrupt your opponents microbiome(s).  See the "Main Phase" rules for playing Microbes.
 * **Events (Pink)**:  These cards are played, their effect is resolved, and they are discarded.  Some of them increase or decrease a player's health.  These effects are indicated in the green and red circles on the card.
 * **Plasmids (Blue)**:  These must be played onto Microbes and they stay in play unless the microbe carrying them is killed.  There are cards that can move them between microbes.
 * **Infections (Yellow)**:  Infections are played on a player and remain in play until the conditions described on the card are fulfilled.  The are not considered Microbes and are therefore immune to cards such as Bacteriophage therapy and the various antibiotics.
